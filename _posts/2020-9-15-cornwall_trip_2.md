<font size="7"> Day 1: 3.5 hours train trip from London to Plymouth, Clovelly</font>
<br />
I and my husband had a 6-days vacation to Cornwall, a south-western county in England. I like the sea, it has a sort of therapeutic effect on me. 
<br />
We took a train from London which was to take us to Plymouth, from there we were to rent a car and travel to Clovelly.
Clovelly is a small fishing village in the Devon county. It doesn’t have any paved roads. Every visitor has to buy a ticket for the entry to the place which seems little expensive but I would say that the experience of roaming around that enchanting place is worth the cost of one-time visit. The path to the harbor is quite steep, so it can be strenuous for some people, especially on rainy days because the ‘stone road’ is just paved with stone chunks and hence can get slippery.
<br />
The view just after we started our walk down to the village. It was a pretty day!

<br />
We spent around 1.5-2 hours in this place. Then we headed to our hotel to rest for the night. We stayed at West County Inn hotel.

<br />
We were ravenous by the time we reached, so we freshened up quickly in order to go for the dinner. We are vegetarians, hence, it is not easy for us to expect great veg items in most of the places(also, because the veg food options are quite limited). But we were in for a surprise this time, in fact all of the meals(vegetarians) we had on this tip was quite delicious. I love it when I can eat good food while being on a trip. That just increases the quality of my vacation.

<br />
<br />
<font size="7"> Day 2: St Ages, Gwithian Beach & St. Ives</font>
<br />
The next day we headed down towards the Penzance, where our AirBnB booked for the next 5-days was waiting for us. I think we did a mistake in this case. While Airbnb we stayed at was amazing, but every day we had to drive up and down a lot to go to places like Tintagel, Fowey, etc. Something in the middle of the county might have had proved better in terms of commute.
<br />
On the way to our accommodation our first stop was(almost) Padstow. Padstow is supposed to be a pretty fishing village. Well, we did enter into the place and headed to the car park, but that is where misfortune stuck us. There was no space available. We tried all the car parks in that village but nothing worked out, so disappointed we had to leave. Then on the spot, we decided to visit St Agnes. We chose this because this heritage site was close(of a drive) to Padstow. It was an impromptu stop for us mostly to get over our disappointment of not being able to visit Padstow, but we were pleasantly surprised when we reached this place. What a beauty nestled in a valley surrounded by magnificent hills! The driving was scary, for sure! as it quite a steep narrow road down the valley, but definitely well worth it.

<!-- Walk towards the beach -->

<br />
This beach was pretty raw and rugged, and I think that was one of the reasons what made this because so special. We had our lunch of co-op purchased sandwiches and the cookies at the beach.

<br />
<br />
There was a short hike up one of the hills (well, it was a proper hiking path but we only covered a small part of it since there was a barrier at some distance and we decided(out of tiredness and apprehension) to stop there.

<br />
Next we headed toward Gwithian beach. I had heard that it is one of the prettiest beaches in Cornwall, hence naturally I was very excited about it. Well, it was a fine beach but nowhere as pretty as I expected it to be(as per my taste).

<br />
<br />
Our final destination for the day was St Ives (I guess the most popular city in Cornwall). St Ives was pretty close to Gwithian beach so it didn’t take long for us to reach here. We parked our car and from there it was a walk down to the city and the harbor.

<br />
First we went to the Porthmeor beach. It was nice, and felt quite calm even in the middle of a busy city like St Ives.

<br />
<br />
After spending some time on the beach, we headed to the harbour. It was crowded, but beautiful.

<br />
<br />
Finally we ordered a takeout from a Mexican place, The Mex. Our vegetarian meal of burritos and enchiladas was savory and tasty.

<font size="7"> Day 3: Boscastle, St. Nectan’s Glen, Tintagel Castle & Merlin Cave</font>
<br />
Our airbnb hostess was a very lovely lady. She used to provide sumptuous breakfast every morning despite the COVID restrictions on the minimum contact. 
<br />

<br />
<br />
After breakfast, we headed to Boscastle, which is again a small fishing village nestled in mountains. It is a very small and a cute village. A stream/river(not sure) passes in the middle of the “center” of the village with makes the ambience very charming.

<br />
<br />
The harbor was almost non-existent due to low tide, finally we came to a small cliff which overlooked the “passage" to the sea.

<br />
<br />
After spending some time here, we started for St Nectans Glen. After reaching the St Nectans Glen's car park, we had to walk for around 30 mins to reach the waterfall. It was a very pleasant walk because we were almost in a forest, the aura felt so calm and magical. Definitely one of my favorite places in Cornwall.

<br />
<br />
When we finally reached to the waterfall, it was even better. The waterfall is such that one can go near it, so the beauty is there without the general intimidation of the natural force.

<br />
<br />
Next we headed to the Tintagel castle which is known for being the birthplace of King Arthur and for its outstanding views to sea due to the imposing height that it is build on.
Tintagel bridge is footbridge that connects two cliffs. The height of the bridge(52 meters) can seem terrifying for some people.

<br />
<br />
One has to walk down in order to exit the castle. After climbing down we decided to go to the beach where a waterfall and the Merlin’s cave is located.

After that we headed down to Penzance for our dinner. We ate at Sea Palace Chinese restaurant which served us amazing veg chowmein and fried rice.
