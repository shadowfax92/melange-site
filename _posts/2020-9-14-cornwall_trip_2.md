<font size="6"> Day 4: Fowey & A short stop at Falmouth</font>
We drove up to Fowey in the morning. It was a very picturesque compact town with a lot of lovely spots in and around it.

<br />
We spent some time at the harbour, then we took Esplanade to go to Readymoney Cove and St. Catherine's Castle.(Esplanade is a narrow street with scenic views of the sea) On our way to Readymoney Cove and St. Catherine's Castle we came across a very small 'quiet' garden which awesome views of the sea. It was so pretty and peaceful there that we spent close to 40 mins basking in the sun and taking in the views.

<br />
<br />
The walk to Readymoney Cove is quite easy one. The Cove itself is very good for swimming.

<br />
<br />
Next, we headed to St. Catherine's Castle, which was a short easy hike up from the Cove. The views of the town and the sea from the castle was amazing.

<br />
<br />
Having spent around half a day in Fowey, we decided to go back to Penzance, with a stop at Falmouth for early Dinner. While planning for the trip, we hadn't accounted for the stop at Falmouth because of the time crunch, but we figured that we had enough time for a quick stop. We didn't explore Falmouth much though.

<br />
<br />
We had a vegetarian meal of burger, pizza, some cocktail(I can't remember the name), and hot chocolate at a restaurant called 'The Shed'. The decor of the place was peppy and endearing, and the food was absolutely delectable. Highly recommended if visiting Falmouth!
<br />
<font size="6"> Day 5: Keyence Cove, Sennen Cove, Land's End & Porthcurno Beach</font>
<br />
On the 5th day, we decided to visit around the areas of Penzance. It was the first cloudy day of our trip. The first stop was going to be lizard point, followed by Keyence Cove. But eventually, we decided to visit Keyence Cove only. It is definitely one of the prettiest places in Cornwall.

<br />
From the beach, there was a short climb up to a grassy plateau. The view from the top was amazing.

<br />
Keyence Cove is such a pretty place with so many treasures scattered around it. I could have easily spent the whole day there if we didn't have any plans to visit other places. Definitely a must-see when visiting Cornwall!

<br />
<br />
Next, we headed for the Sennen Cove and Land's end with a stopover at St Michael's Mount. Unfortunately for us, the island was closed for the visitors that day. Nevertheless, we walked down to the island(like everyone else) to take a closer look at it. Shortly, we started for Sennen Cove, a small coastal village at the western end of Cornwall, which was nice and pretty.

<br />
We walked down from the car park and that in itself was a downhill hike but well worth it for the beauty of this place.

<br />
<br />
Then we went to Land's end which was a total disappointment for me. Good that we realised it and left early for the Porthcurno beach.
<br /> 
I had heard the Porthcurno beach is one of the best beaches in Cornwall. And indeed it is! It is a sandy and very picturesque beach.

<br />
<br />
We have a nice story(well not so nice as you will figure out eventually!) at this place. After spending some time on the beach, we started on a hiking path to The Minack Theatre. 
It showed a hike of around 0.3-0.4 miles, that should be very easy, right! Well, it was not! Definitely not for me. The initial walk was okay.

<br />
Then came the scary part. It was a steep hike up the rugged stone steps on the cliff. There was no barrier of any sort on any side. One misstep and most probably I would have ended up in the sea(rolling down the spiked rocks of course). There were a lot of people who were at very ease with that. Kudos to their courage! My legs started shivering once I started climbing up. In the middle of the climb, I decided that I can't go up without running a risk of fainting on the way. I and my partner decided to go back, and boy! that was scary as hell as well because I could see the sea that lay beneath while climbing down. I could see the drop. Well, somehow I managed to get down the steps(I went on all fours to get down each step of the stone blocks). That was one hell of a scare that I am going to remember for a long time.
<br />
Relieved to have reached the car park in one piece, we started back for Penzance to have our dinner, there we ordered a takeout of vegetable chowmein and spring rolls from the Sea Palace restaurant(yes, I liked the food so much that I went there back again), and naan, veg jalfrezi, and paneer chilli from an Indian restaurant called 'Taj Mahal'. The food from both places was delicious.
<br />
<font size="6"> Day 6: Polperro & the train ride back to London </font>
Finally came the day of our departure from Cornwall. We were a little exhausted by now, driving extensively for the past 5 days. We started for Plymouth where we had to board our train. We decided to make a stop at Polperro, a large village in south Cornwall. We weren't looking forward to anything when we visited this place but we were so pleasantly surprised when we reached Polperro. What a gem of a place! Definitely the best village we visited in Cornwall. It was such an alluring village with many houses/cottages lining the streets across a beautiful stream that runs through the village. The houses had tiny beautiful garden lush with flowers. It was very pretty. There were many cute restaurants dispersed in the village. We immediately realized that this place would have been a perfect place to base oneself and even spend a few days lounging around in many charming spots of the village.

There was also a climb up a cliff where one can soak in the magnificent views of the village and the sea.

Cornwall is stated as a place where land meets the sea, and indeed this could not be more true. There are many quaint villages and towns with cute houses and busy, but beautiful, harbors. Six days were too little to do justice to this gorgeous county. We covered so little, and still, it was a jam-packed six days vacation for us. Hopefully, we will be back someday to bask in its charm and beauty again.
